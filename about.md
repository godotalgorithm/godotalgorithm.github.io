Jonathan Moussa [[CV](/assets/CV.pdf)] is a computational physicist whose primary research interest is
method development for simulations of electrons and nuclei in materials and molecules.
His career to-date has spanned four distinct periods of technical focus:

* 1998-2002: learning scientific programming & computational physics

* 2002-2014: ab initio electronic structure (DFT-based materials design & method development)

* 2014-2018: quantum computing (quantum error correction & quantum simulation algorithms)

* 2018-present: semiempirical electronic structure

The main purpose of this blog is to revitalize semiempirical electronic structure through visible research activity,
 including advocacy and promotion of this topic, literature reviews and analysis, new methodological research, and software developement.
Related topics of discussion include atomistic simulation, quantum computing, scientific computing, numerical analysis, and novel algorithms.
